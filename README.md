## About Me
My name is Jared and I am an electrical engineer for a small engineering firm you've probably never heard of. I occasionally work on hobby projects and post them here if I think they have any value to the world. I also enjoy adding new tools to my arsenal, which is why I started using GitHub in the first place.

## Interests
My interests wax and wane with the tides, orbital precession, sunspots, and I wouldn't be suprised if tea leaves were involved somehow too. With that being said, my main areas of interest are embedded systems, RF systems, measurment/calibration equipment, computers, OSS... etc. If it is in one of those categories, chances are I'll eventually get around to it. Everything else however, it at the mercy of whatever I find an interesting idea at the time.

## What You Will See Here
In an attemp at better orginization and to learn how GitHub works out of curiosity, I have started to use git on my personal projects and upload them to GitHub. I won't even pretent that I will be diligent in keeping the repositories up to date and synced with my progress, but I am gonna try.
