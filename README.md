### About Me
My name is Jared Jackson and I am an electrical engineering student at NMT. I enjoy learning new tools, which is why I started using GitHub in the first place.

### Interests
My interests wax and wane like the tides, orbital precession, sunspots, and I wouldn't be suprised if tea leaves were involved somehow too. With that being said, my main areas of interest are embedded systems, RF systems, measurment/calibration equipment, computers, OSS... etc. If it is in one of those categories, chances are I'll eventually get around to it. Everything else however, it at the mercy of whatever I find an interesting idea at the time.

### What You Will See Here
In an attemp at better orginization and to learn how GitHub works out of curiosity, I have started to use git on my personal projects and upload them to GitHub. I won't even pretent that I will be diligent in keeping the repositories up to date and synced my my progress, but I am gonna try. As I have said, this is mostly for myself, but if you find something useful here, well I know how happy I am when I fine something on GitHub so I'd be happy if you found the same here.
